      <h2 class="Page-content__section__subtitle">All about Moovyn</h2></section>
    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">Why should I use Moovyn rather than a high-street estate agent?</h2>
      <p>Moovyn is a fixed price, simple and transparent way to sell your home. We provide the full estate agency service you would expect from the high-street combined with the ease and convenience of 24-hour online access to the latest updates on your
        sale.</p>
      <p>Each Moovyn area has a genuinely <a href="/estate-agents">Local Estate Agent</a> who will support youthroughout your sale. Our agents are motivated first and foremost by providing a great service for our customers. With around-the-clock support
        and <a href="https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/moovyn.com">5 star-rated customer service</a>, we put our users at the heart of everything we do.</p>
      <p>Included as standard in our package is a free no-obligation valuation, professional photographs, floorplans, for-sale board, expert marketing of your property on the major online property portals, and sales progression all the way through to completion.</p>
      <p>Unlike a high street estate agent, we also give you 24-hour access to our online platform, from which you can oversee all aspects of your sale whenever you like, using your computer, phone or tablet. This means that you don’t need to worry about
        office hours and never miss out on viewings or offers because someone can't get hold of you.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">How much does it cost to sell my home with Moovyn?</h2>
      <p>A low, fixed fee of &pound;840, will cover everything you need to sell your home: from a dedicated local Moovyn estate agent and marketing of your property, to sales progression all the way through to completion.</p>
      <p>Because everyone’s needs are different, we also offer a few optional extras:</p>
      <h4>Viewings</h4>
      <p>We think you're the best person to show off your property to potential buyers, and they prefer this too. However, if you would rather we took care of this, we're happy to. Our fee for managing and hosting viewings is just &pound;300 (inc VAT).</p>
      <h4>Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)</h4>
      <p>EPCs tell you how energy efficient a building is and give it a rating from A (very efficient) to G (inefficient). Legally your property's EPC needs to be available to potential buyers as soon as you start to market your property for sale or rent.</p>
      <p>You may already have an EPC as they are valid for 10 years unless you make any modifications to your property.</p>
      <p>Moovyn are happy to provide you with a legally-compliant EPC - this costs just &pound;120 (inc VAT). Your agent will talk to you about whether or not you need one, and arrange for this as part of our listing process if required.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">Why can’t I just use Rightmove or Zoopla?</h2>
      <p>Sites like Rightmove, Zoopla and PrimeLocation are portals. Think of them like shop windows which showcase properties for sale. However, the general public cannot sell their property directly with those sites – you must go through an estate agent.</p>
      <p>When you sell your home with Moovyn, we will automatically list it on all the major property websites that only agents can advertise on including Rightmove and Zoopla.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">Are my personal details secure if I sell my home with Moovyn?</h2>
      <p>Of course! We keep your details safe, secure and confidential at all times. We will never share your details with any potential buyers, marketers or other bodies without your prior permission. Please see our Terms and Conditions for more details.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">Are there any hidden fees with Moovyn?</h2>
      <p>Absolutely not. We pride ourselves on being completely transparent about our fees.</p>
      <p>We charge a fixed fee of &pound;840 to sell your home. You can either pay upfront, or defer your payment for six months. If you need it, we offer viewings management for &pound;300 and can produce an EPC for &pound;120.

    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">Do I still have to pay if my home hasn't sold?</h2>

    </section>
    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">Does Moovyn check potential buyers?</h2>
      <p>Yes - we take every potential buyer’s full name, address and contact telephone number prior to any viewings.</p>

      <p>We'll list your home for sale and provide you with support until it sells - no matter how long that takes.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Page-content__section">

        and we do not offer refunds if you decide to cancel your listing.</p>

    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">Who will value my home and set the sale price?</h2>
      <p>We offer a free, no-obligation valuation service, which will be conducted by your dedicated local Moovyn estate agent.</p>
      <p>Because our fees are fixed we always offer objective, honest valuations based on our industry knowledge and experience. Remember though, our recommendations are just that – recommendations. We'll work with you to find a sale price that you are happy
        with.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">Who creates my property description?</h2>
      <p>Once you instruct Moovyn, your dedicated Moovyn estate agent will visit your property, take photos and details, and draw up a floor plan. They will then create a professional advert for you, including a full and detailed description. Once you’ve
        reviewed it and are happy, it’ll go live on the UK’s biggest property portals.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">Who shows buyers around my property?</h2>
      <p>As you are the expert on your property, we believe you are the best person to host prospective buyers and show your home off. Buyers prefer this too. Sellers are often surprised by how much they enjoy hosting their own viewings - and nobody knows
        your property like you do, from the practical basics to the little details, like what the local schools are like and what time of day the garden gets the sun.</p>
      <p>However, if for whatever reason you would prefer us to do the viewings on your behalf then your Moovyn estate agent can manage and host them for you for an additional fee of &pound;300 (inc VAT).</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">Will I get a ‘For Sale’ board outside my property?</h2>
      <p>Your Moovyn For Sale board is included for free – unless you’d rather not have one. For Sale boards are a great way to let the local area know that your home is on the market. We'll deliver and erect the board outside your property, so you don’t
        have to lift a finger.</p>

      <p>Conveyancing refers to all the legal and administrative work involved in selling your land, property, or home, and transferring ownership from you to another person or party.</p>
      <p>Conveyancing is a key part of selling your home. The conveyancing process starts as soon as you accept an offer for your property and exchange details of solicitors with the buyer.</p>

    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">Do I need a solicitor?</h2>

      <p>At Moovyn we believe in transparency in our work and our fees. We do charge a higher fee for Pay Later, however, unlike others we don’t tie you in to other services such as conveyancing or hide the costs for a later date.</p>

    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">How do I use Pay Later?</h2>
      <p>Pay Later is quick and easy to use. Simply select the checkbox when you instruct, read and agree to the terms and conditions and, if you're happy to proceed, submit your application. Moovyn will carry out an electronic credit check for an instant
        decision.</p>

    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">When do I have to pay off my Pay Later Fee?</h2>
      <p>With Pay Later on Moovyn, you don't have to pay the full fee up front before you list your property for sale. In fact, you only need to pay &pound;300 (incl VAT) with the remainder of your fee due when your property either sells or six months after,
        whichever is the sooner.</p>

    <section class="Page-content__section">

    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">Why was I declined for Pay Later?</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, we aren't told why a customer is declined for finance. The final approval decision rests with the finance company rather than with Moovyn, but quite often declines are the result of entering incorrect information. Please check carefully
        that you enter all required information.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">Do I need to pay a deposit when using Pay Later?</h2>
      <p>The full fee is not due upon instructing your local Moovyn agent, you only need pay &pound;300 (incl VAT) upfront with the discount code provided to get the ball rolling and list the property.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">Is my Pay Later application confidential?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Your Pay Later application is treated in the strictest confidence. We will never contact your employer, bank or any other third party.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Page-content__section">
      <h2 class="Page-content__section__title">Who should I contact if I have a question about Pay Later?</h2>
