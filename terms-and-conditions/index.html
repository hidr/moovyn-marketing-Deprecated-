        <p class="Page-content__text">If you cancel after we have started the Services, you must pay us for the Services provided up until the time you tell us that you have changed your mind. In this event the Fees applicable for cancellations after we have started the Services are:</p>

        <p class="Page-content__text">If you have taken our accompanied viewings package the fee is non-refundable in the event of cancellation. Even if you have not had any accompanied viewings we will still be deemed to have provided the service by assigning an agent and maintaining
          their reasonable availability and capacity on your behalf.</p>

        <p class="Page-content__text">Even if we are not at fault and you do not have a right to change your mind or cancel (see 'Cancellations' above), you can still end the contract before it is completed but you may have to pay us compensation. A contract for services is completed
          when we have finished providing the services and you have paid for them. If you want to end a contract before it is completed where we are not at fault and you have no right to cancel, contact us to let us know. The contract will end immediately
          and we will refund any sums paid by you for Services not provided but we may deduct from that refund (or if you have not paid, charge you) reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of your ending the contract.</p>

        <h4>Providing the Services</h4>
        <p class="Page-content__text">We will begin the Services on the date you Instruct us. We are not able to give an estimated completion date for the Services as it depends on completion of the Sale of your Property.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">Provided that you have subscribed we will make access to the Moovyn Online Platform available to you as soon as you Instruct us.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">We will supply the Services to you until either the Services are completed or you or us end the contract as provided in these Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">We are not responsible for delays or Interruptions outside our control. We will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this, we will not be liable for delays caused
          by the event but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end the contract and receive a refund for any products you have paid for but not received.</p>
        <p class="Page-conent__text">We may need certain information from you so that we can supply the Services to you. If so, this will have been stated in the Website. We will contact you to ask for this information. If you do not give us this information within a reasonable time
          of us asking for it, or if you give us incomplete or incorrect information we may either end the contract or make an additional charge of a reasonable sum to compensate us for any extra work that is required as a result. We will not be responsible
          for supplying the Services late or not supplying any part of them if this is caused by you not giving us the information we need within a reasonable time of us asking for it.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">We may have to suspend the supply of Services to you to (a) deal with technical problems or make minor technical changes; (b) update the Services to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements and (c) make changes to the Services
          as requested by you or notified by us to you. We will contact you in advance to tell you we will be suspending supply of the Services unless the problem is urgent or an emergency. If we have to suspend the Services for longer than 7 days we
          will adjust the price accordingly. You may contact us to end the contract if we suspend it or tell you we are going to suspend it, in each case for a period of more than 7 days and we will refund any sums you have paid in advance for the Services
          in respect of the period after you end the contract.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">We may also suspend supply of the Services if you do not pay and you still do not make payment of any outstanding amounts of the Services Fee within 14 days of us reminding you that payment is due until you have paid us the outstanding amounts.
          We may also charge you interest on your overdue payments.</p>
        <h4>Approving your Advert</h4>
        <p class="Page-content__text">Once you Instruct us, a Local Property Expert will create your Advert which will be sent to you for approval as soon as the Advert is available. We always aim to do this as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, as amended by the Consumer Protection (Amendment) Regulations 2014 require you to disclose any information you are aware of that relates to the Property in a clear, intelligible form
          and in a timely manner. You must ensure that all descriptions, photographs, floor plans and information uploaded and/or used in any advertising and marketing are accurate, current and are in no way misleading. If any of the information you provide
          or approve is or is found to be in breach of these terms, it will be removed immediately. You will not be entitled to a refund in respect of Advertised Rates under these circumstances.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">If you become aware of any matters that may affect the accuracy of the sales particulars, you agree to advise the Local Property Expert in writing immediately.</p>
        <h4>Fixtures and Fittings</h4>
        <p class="Page-content__text">To comply with the requirements of the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991, all fixtures and fittings that are mentioned in the sales particulars will be deemed included in the sale unless otherwise specified in writing.</p>
        <h4>Extras</h4>
        <p class="Page-content__text">Extras are a unique opportunity for you to offer your Property for sale and/or let with certain value added extras.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">You can choose to offer any one or more from the list of Extras and you can include a maximum value. You can also change these from time to time or withdraw them.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">By adding an Extra to your marketing, you agree to offer that Extra to the purchaser/tenant if an offer is accepted by you. You further agree to be bound by the terms associated with that Extra, as applicable.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">Where notified, some Extras are conditional upon you using the Conveyancing Services and by offering that Extra, you agree to use the Conveyancing Services.</p>
        <h4>Energy Performance Certificate (‘EPC’)</h4>
        <p class="Page-content__text">It is a legal requirement for you to have commissioned an EPC before we are able to start the marketing of your Property. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have a valid and up to date EPC in place before your Advert goes live. The Moovyn
          Online Platform will prompt you about the obtaining of an EPC and will not let you publish the Advert until you have either provided an EPC or ordered one from us.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">If you have an EPC that has been supplied to you by a third party, the terms of that supply must include the right for us or a third party employed by us to use the EPC in order to meet our legal obligations. In the event of any third party seeking
          damages from us or a third party engaged by us on the grounds that our use of the EPC to meet our legal obligations has infringed their rights, you will be liable for any costs and damages we and/or a third party engaged by us incur.</p>
        <h4>Advertising and Marketing</h4>
        <p class="Page-content__text">We will advertise and market your Property and the Content for the Advertisement Period on such property portals, websites or publications as we consider to be the most effective at securing interest on your property from potential purchasers
          and tenants in our absolute discretion. We may withdraw or no longer take advantage of the services of such property portals, websites or publications at our absolute discretion.</p>
        <h4>For Sale Boards</h4>
        <p class="Page-content__text">Where you instruct Moovyn to sell your property, we will arrange for one ‘For Sale’ board to be erected free of charge (if included as part of the Services). All subsequent boards will be charged at the Advertised Rates in force from time to time
          and published on the Moovyn online platform.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">Where we provide a complimentary ‘For Sale’ board:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All boards shall belong to Moovyn although it is your responsibility to ensure they are safe and secure and preserved for collection once the property is sold or is withdrawn from the market;</li>
          <li>If we cannot collect a board that we are able to use again we will charge you to replace the board at the rates in force at that time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Page-content__text">Under current legislation only one board is permitted per Property and you agree not to allow the display of any other For Sale board at the same time.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">At the end of your contract, you agree that we shall be able to collect the 'For Sale' board without any further permission from you.</p>
        <h4>Viewings</h4>
        <p class="Page-content__text">Subject to Interruption we will arrange and record viewings through the Moovyn Online Platform. You will be notified immediately once a viewing is booked. We will provide you with the name of the person(s) who wish to view together with the date
          and time.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">If Moovyn are conducting the viewings on your behalf, you will still be notified of the above information.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">If you take advantage of the viewings service offered by Moovyn, we will conduct up to 15 accompanied viewings for a fixed price as advertised from time to time. Under these circumstances, it is still your responsibility to ensure that the Property
          is ready and prepared for the viewing, is in a safe condition and that the Local Property Expert has access to the Property at the date and time of the viewing.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">In the event we have conducted a large number of viewings on your behalf and you have received regular feedback to suggest that the price of the property is too high, we will want to conduct a marketing review call to discuss the best way forward.
          We reserve the right to withdraw the viewings service at any time but only where we consider that it is unreasonable to expect Moovyn to continue to accompany viewings taking into account the number of viewings and the feedback received. You
          shall not be entitled to a refund of the Advertised Rates under these circumstances.</p>
        <h4>Keys</h4>
        <p class="Page-content__text">If you take advantage of the viewings service offered by Moovyn you shall supply Moovyn with two sets of keys for all lockable doors, cupboards and areas that form part of the Property. We shall store these in a safe and secure locked cabinet.
        </p>
        <h4>Empty properties</h4>
        <p class="Page-content__text">If your Property is empty, you shall ensure that you conduct regular security and condition checks from time to time. Moovyn shall not be responsible for doing so.</p>
        <h4>Recording your viewing availability</h4>
        <p class="Page-content__text">Subject to Interruption, if you have chosen to conduct your own viewings you may enter details into the Moovyn online platform of when you are available. This will enable people who want to view, to choose a date and time to suit them. You will
          be notified when a viewing is booked. Where a viewing is requested outside of this availability, the Moovyn Online Platform will ask that you confirm the viewing. It is your responsibility to do this immediately.</p>
        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        <p class="Page-content__text">We will request feedback from every person who has viewed or was due to view your property. The Moovyn Online Platform will prompt them for feedback at least three times unless they confirm that they do not wish to provide feedback. You can track
          these requests in the Moovyn Online Platform.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">The feedback will be immediately available in your Account as soon as it has been provided and will be exactly as provided by the person concerned. The Moovyn Online Platform is the most transparent for providing information.</p>
        <h4>Offers</h4>
        <p class="Page-content__text">Subject to Interruption we will report offers to you immediately when they are made via the Moovyn Online Platform. The nature, extent, position of the potential purchaser or tenant and desire to proceed, will be requested and provided to you
          automatically as the offer is made.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">We will make such reasonable checks as are possible to ensure the offer made meets our criteria for a sale or let to proceed.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">The information will always be made available exactly how it is provided by the potential purchaser or tenant through the Moovyn Online Platform.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">You will get a choice whether to accept the offer, reject the offer, reject and negotiate. You will get to choose one of these options each time you receive an offer.</p>
        <h4>Provision of personal information</h4>
        <p class="Page-content__text">For the effective use of the Services we will be providing certain people with personal information such as your name, address, contact details, viewing availability, agreed sale price and position to proceed. Please read the Terms of Use and
          our Privacy Policy for more information, terms, and conditions. It is your responsibility to provide accurate up to date personal information through the Moovyn Online Platform.</p>
        <p class="Page-content__text">In the event that you choose to Pay Later we will disclose to the Provider such information as we request from you on the Moovyn Online Platform when you Instruct Moovyn and when any event should occur that represents a Deferred Payment Date.</p>
        <p
          class="Page-content__text">Moovyn is registered with the ICO; registration reference: ZA196080. For all queries relating to handling of your personal information please contact <a href="mailto:ico@moovyn.com">ico@moovyn.com</a>.</p>
          <h4>Personal interest</h4>
          <p class="Page-content__text">We will always inform you as soon as we become aware of anyone making an offer for your Property that is in any way connected with Moovyn; whether they are employed, a contractor, family member or providing services to us.</p>
          <p class="Page-content__text">In the event that you are aware of any personal interest from anyone connected with Moovyn you should notify us immediately. We will then make such enquiries as we consider necessary and provide you with a notification in writing of the nature
            of the personal interest. You will have the sole discretion to decide whether you wish to deal with the person or persons concerned. We will never knowingly permit any offer to be made or sale agreed with someone connected to Moovyn unless
            we have provided you with written notice. This written notice will ordinarily be displayed when you review the offer.</p>
          <p class="Page-content__text">Before your Advert is published, Moovyn will ask you whether you are in any way connected with Moovyn; whether you are employed, a contractor, family member or providing services to us. This will be disclosed to all potential purchasers or tenants.</p>
          <h4>Advertising</h4>
          <p class="Page-content__text">You agree that the Local Property Expert may mention the Property (but your name or identity) for general advertising purposes following the sale.</p>
          <h4>Third party companies</h4>
          <p class="Page-content__text">We will introduce to you, the buyer or any prospective buyer (where we deem appropriate and/or necessary) third party services (<strong>'Third Party Services'</strong>) such as mortgages, insurance, letting services and conveyancing but only
            where we reasonably believe that the Third Party Services being provided are in the best interests of you, the buyer or prospective buyer and further that the third party companies are capable and required to, provide an exceptional service.</p>
          <p
            class="Page-content__text">We may receive commission for introducing you but only when you agree to take advantage of such products or services. You may decide of your own free will and we will never pressurise or require you to use such products or services. You hereby
            expressly agree and accept that in the event that we introduce a product or service from a third party company that we may accept a payment or commission as a result of that introduction.</p>
            <p class="Page-content__text">Where requested, we will instruct on your behalf third parties to conduct some of the services advertised by Moovyn. Whilst we will make all reasonable efforts to ensure that they continue to provide an exceptional service we cannot accept
              liability for the conduct and service of those third parties acting on your behalf.</p>
            <h4>Availability of the Services</h4>
            <p class="Page-content__text">Whilst we will make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the Services are available at all times, Moovyn does not guarantee, represent or warrant that your access to any of the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free.</p>
            <p class="Page-content__text">We will always make all reasonable efforts to ensure that all Content submitted by you to us will be secure. We cannot guarantee that the Moovyn Online Platform, Services, or the Website will be free from loss, corruption, attack, viruses,
              ‘worms’, ‘trojan horses’ or other harmful components, or from interference, hacking or other security intrusions. You should be sure to back up your own system periodically to ensure that all Content available to you and located within your
              Account, is available to you in the event of any loss or damage as Moovyn reserves the right to remove or suspend all or any part of the Content, at any time in accordance with these terms. We shall have no responsibility whatsoever in relation
              to the listing of your Advert and/or the availability of the Services on <a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk">www.rightmove.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://www.zoopla.co.uk">www.zoopla.co.uk</a> or any other third party websites or property
              portals we may advertise your Property on as this may be included in the Services.</p>
            <h5 class="text-highlight-warning">Please read the Terms of Use for further information.</h5>
            <h4>The Property Ombudsman</h4>
            <p class="Page content__text">We are members of the TPO Scheme and abide by the TPO Code of Practice. You agree that, in the event of your making a complaint to the TPO or to the TPO redress scheme, we may disclose information relating to the sale of your property to the
              Ombudsman. You also agree that we may disclose your contact details to TPO Ltd (who are responsible for running the TPO Scheme) to assist them in their monitoring of our compliance with the TPO Code of Practice.</p>
            <h4>Limitation of liability</h4>
            <p class="Page-content__text">If we fail to comply with these Terms &amp; Conditions, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill but we are not responsible
              for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen.</p>
            <p class="Page-content__text">We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so.</p>
            <p class="Page-content__text">If we are providing services to your Property, we will make good any damage to your Property caused by us while doing so. However, we are not responsible for the cost of repairing any pre-existing faults or damage to your Property that we
              discover while providing the Services.</p>
            <p class="Page-content__text">Any products provided to you are only for private use. We shall not be liable for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption or loss of business opportunity if these are used for commercial or business purpose.</p>
            <h4>How we may use your personal information</h4>
            <p class="Page-content__text">We will use your personal information you provide to us:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>(1) to supply the Services to you; and</li>
              <li>(2) to process your payment for the Services.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="Page-content__text">We will pass your personal information to the Provider where you opt to Pay Later.</p>
            <h4>Other important terms</h4>
            <p class="Page-content__text">We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms and conditions to another organisation. We will contact you to let you know if we plan to do this. If you are unhappy with the transfer, you may contact us with 14 days of us telling
              you about it and we will refund you any payments you have made in advance for Services not provided.</p>
            <p class="Page-conent__text">You will need our prior written consent to transfer your rights to someone else.</p>
            <p class="Page-content__text">Nobody else has any rights under this contract. This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms.</p>
            <p class="Page-content__text">If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force. Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decided that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining
              paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p>
            <p class="Page-content__text">Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. For example if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the Services, we can still require you to make the payment at a later date.</p>
            <p
              class="Page-content__text">These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of England and Wales. We both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales which means that you may bring a claim to enforce your consumer protection
              rights in connection with these terms in England and Wales or in the European Union country in which you live.</p>
